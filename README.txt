I have included four files for review for marking.

My final report is named Final_report_DK_Kim.docx

Please run the Jupyter Notebook in following order:

1. Data_collection_final.ipynb

2. EDA_final.ipynb

3. Modelling_final.ipynb

The files in data folders are needed to render my codes in

python workbooks. I did my best to keep the report under

1500 words and provided more detailed explanations in workbooks.

I commented the codes for exporting the data so there

would not be any mix ups when markers run my code. I provided

you with data folder that contains every csv, excel and png files 

that I used on my workbooks. I triple checked on these notebooks

and I had no issues with results so I expect the same.

I hope you find my comments easy to follow to see what I am doing

with lines of codes and thank you for taking your time on marking 

my very first capstone project. Hope you have a great holiday

and keep in touch!
